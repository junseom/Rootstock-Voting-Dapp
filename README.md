Decentralized Voting Application
Overview

The Decentralized Voting Application is a blockchain-based voting system designed to ensure transparency, security, and integrity in the voting process. Built using Solidity smart contracts and integrated with a Next.js frontend, this project allows users to create voting sessions, add proposals, and cast or remove votes in a decentralized manner.
Features

    Create Voting Sessions: Initiate new voting sessions.
    Add and Remove Proposals: Manage proposals within each session.
    Cast and Remove Votes: Vote for or remove votes from proposals.
    Transparency: All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (version 14.x or later)
    npm (usually comes with Node.js)
    Hardhat (for Ethereum development)
    Git (for version control)

Installation
1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone git@github.com:Pulsator01/Decentralised-Voting-Application.git
cd Decentralised-Voting-Application

2. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

bash

cd backend
npm install

3. Configure Hardhat

    Install Dependencies:

    Install Hardhat and its required packages:

    bash

npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers

Configure Hardhat:

Create a .env file in the backend directory to store your environment variables. This file should include your RSK Testnet or Mainnet credentials:

env

    RSK_API_URL=<your-rsk-api-url>
    PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>

    Ensure you update the hardhat.config.js file with your network settings.

4. Deploy the Smart Contract

    Compile the Contract:

    Compile your smart contracts using Hardhat:

    bash

npx hardhat compile

Deploy the Contract:

Run the deployment script to deploy your smart contract to the blockchain:

bash

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>

    Replace <network> with your target network (e.g., rskTestnet).

5. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

bash

cd ../frontend
npm install

6. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add your smart contract address and ABI:

env

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your-deployed-contract-address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ABI=<your-contract-abi>

7. Run the Application

Start the Next.js development server:

bash

npm run dev

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
Usage

    Access the Application:
        Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

    Interact with the Voting Interface:
        Create a Voting Session: Click on "Create Session" to start a new voting session.
        Add Proposals: Add new proposals to the active session.
        Vote: Select a proposal and cast your vote.
        Remove Votes: Remove votes from a proposal if needed.
        Remove Proposals: Remove proposals from the session if required.

Troubleshooting

    Contract Deployment Issues:
        Ensure you have sufficient gas for deployment.
        Verify your network configuration in hardhat.config.js.

    Frontend Issues:
        Check that your .env variables are correctly configured.
        Ensure the smart contract ABI and address are correct in the .env file.
